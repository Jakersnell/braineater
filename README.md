# Braineater
#### Notice! Brainfuck is the academically accepted name of the language and I mean no offense.

## What is brainfuck?
Brainfuck is a stack based low-level esoteric programming language invented in the 1990s by Urban MÃ¼ller. The goal of the project was to create a minimal language with the smallest compiler possible while still being turing complete. The result is a language that is incredibly hard to use, and very entertaining to write.

## About
A brainfuck compiler written in rust, developed as an introduction into compiler design and generating assembly code. Current only supports macOS with M1.
This project was really fun, I used Rust to write this compiler that takes in a .bf source file and outputs a .s ARM64 assembly file, and assembles and links the file for mac AArch64.
I learned a lot about how compilers work during this process, and I am excited to create more compilers in the future.

## Why braineater?
I think the name sounds funny, like the compiler is a zombie, writing brainfuck code certainly made me feel like a zombie.
