# Braineater
#### Notice! Brainfuck is the academically accepted name of the language and I mean no offense.
A brainfuck compiler written in rust, developed as an introduction into compiler design and generating assembly code. Current only supports macOS with M1.
This project was really fun, I used Rust to write this compiler that takes in a .bf source file and outputs a .s ARM64 assembly file, and assembles and links the file for mac AArch64.
I learned a lot about how compilers work during this process, and I am excited to create more compilers in the future.
